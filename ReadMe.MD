* To navigate - please change the branch to which tutorial you want.
* To create the base console application, go to this discord server or follow the instructions.

Discord Server : https://discord.gg/4GP6rXf

Instructions : 

1 : Have VSCode and .NET **SDK** installed (links below) 

2 : Open the command prompt

3 : Type the following :
dotnet new console -o [name of the console app]
This will automatically make a simple console application with a file called Program.cs inside.
Then, type :
cd [name of the console app]
code .
The dotnet command you run earlier created a folder with a Program.cs file inside of it.
Typing code . will open visual studio code in that folder.

4 : Running the code 
Click on the bottom right of the VSCode interface, where there are the warnings and problems count.

This will open a built-in terminal, where you will type dotnet commands to run your code ; in this case, it is :
dotnet run

The program will output "Hello World!" in the same console window.

There you go, that was the console application !
